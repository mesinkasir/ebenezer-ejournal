# 📚 Ebenezer Content Manager (Sveltia CMS)

Welcome to the Ebenezer admin panel! This guide will help you manage your journal's articles, authors, and site settings without needing to write any code.

## 🌟 What is Sveltia CMS?
Sveltia is the "interface" for your website. Every time you click Save or Publish, Sveltia sends those changes to GitHub. Your website then detects the change and updates itself automatically within a few minutes.

## 🛠️ How to Access the Admin Panel
Open your browser and go to: your-domain.com/admin/
+ Click the Login with GitHub button.
+ If GitHub asks for permission, click Authorize.
+ You are now in the Dashboard.

## 📝 Managing Content
1. Writing a New Article (Articles)
+ Click Articles in the left sidebar.
+ Click the New Article button.
+ Featured Image: You can upload images directly from your computer.
+ Authors: Enter the author's unique ID (e.g., john-dhoe). If there are multiple authors, separate them with a comma (e.g., john-dhoe, jon-jones).
+ Body: Use the built-in editor to format your text (bold, italics, links, etc.).

2. Managing Authors (Global Data > Authors List)
+ To add a new contributor:
+ Go to Global Data -> Authors List.
+ Click Add Item at the bottom.
+ Fill in their full name, short bio, and upload a profile picture.
+ Important: Take note of the Key (e.g., budi-santoso). This is the ID you will type in the "Authors" field when creating an article.

3. Updating Site Design & Info
+ To change the website title or footer text:
+ Go to Global Data -> Design & Navbar.
+ Edit the text or upload a new logo.
+ Click Save.

## ⚠️ Important Things to Remember
+ Build Time: After you click Publish, the changes are not instant. GitHub takes about 1-2 minutes to "rebuild" your site. Refresh your main website after a short wait.
+ Login Issues?: Ensure you have an active internet connection and that your GitHub account has "Write" access to the Ebenezer repository.
+ Images: All uploaded images are automatically optimized and stored in the public/img folder.
